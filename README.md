VssSvnConverter
====================

Yet another converter of Visual Source Safe database to Subversion repository

Why?

This converter was written and tested during gradual conversion of 18GB VSS repository to Subversion.
No one other tool(which I try), such as Vss2Svn, VssMigrate was unable do this work. It is too big, to complex and corrupted.

So, this converter has advantages and disadvantages.

Most significant disadvantages is

This tool require setup in config files and has _very_ minimalistic GUI.
* Converted only currently visible sources tree, i.e:
* Deleted files not converted
* Moved files will be look as if already live on last place
* Copied files will not have common ancestor.
* Empty directories not converted

But, also took has next advantages:

* If you have big (really BIG) VSS repository, it is possible convert only part of it. Then next piece, next... We continue such continuous conversion already 1.5 years.
* Tool has rich filtration rules for prevent conversion unnecessary files in destination repository
* Tool use COM interface to VSS database, but in case of error also try CLI (ss.exe). Some time CLI interface work correct, while COM - failed.
* For several conversion tries used file cache for speedup access to VSS
* Setting for grouping changed into commits
* Mapping user names
* Correct import of pinned files (only latest version)


Conversion procedure
--------------------

# Modify in VssSvnConverter.conf file path to source safe database (full path to sourcesafe.ini file), username and password
# Select one or many VSS project for import and add to config file
# Modify import patterns for exclude *.*scc files (you want it) and possibly other incorrectly stored: dll, exe, pdb ...
# If you have autogenerated files, which checked in after each nightly build, this files can be stored with only latest version (for avoid noise in history). Use latest-only ke in config
# start build import list with command 'VssSvnConverter.exe build-list'
Will be generated file 1-import-list.txt and 1-import-list-exts.txt. Second one for information only. First contains all files for conversion. You can use any text editor for remove some unwanted files.
# start build list of all versions of all files with command 'VssSvnConverter.exe build-version'
Again, some versions can be removed in any text editor.
# start build cache with command 'VssSvnConverter.exe build-version'
# start build commits with command 'VssSvnConverter.exe build-commits'
You can change commit grouping settings an rerun this command many times
# create SVN working copy where will be performed import with command 'VssSvnConverter.exe build-wc'
# start import with command 'VssSvnConverter.exe import'

Obtained repository can be checked and then dumped and loaded in production Subversion repository
